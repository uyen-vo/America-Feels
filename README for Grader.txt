README for Grader:

Our web application is using HTML/CSS along with Node JS for the sockets between server and client in order to live stream from the Twitter Stream API. We are currently hosting our application on Amazon Web Services and instructions on how to deploy our entire application from start to finish can be found in our repository: https://github.com/AmericaFeels/AmericaFeels.github.io under the README.md.

However, we have already deployed it on AWS and you can find our entire application at the following link: http://lowcost-env.ab7a25j9zc.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/

If you would like to have access to our AWS console and Beanstalk on where we deployed our application (without having to deploy it yourself), we have also granted access to you with the following credentials:

Username: CSCE315-Access
Password: fLzV-}$(5rOT
Console Login Link: https://675417381333.signin.aws.amazon.com/console

NOTE: We are limited to 5000 uses on our text analysis API so each time the site is run the number of analyzed tweets has been limited to 70.
